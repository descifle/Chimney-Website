                                Baltimore. He and his crew were very clean and honest with their inspection. They were
                                able to convert our traditional fireplace to a Regency gas fireplace.</p>
                            <p>Once everything was installed, Wayne followed up to make sure we were pleased with the
                                service and product. A few months later I got a call that the blower came in and they
                                were going to come back out and install it. That was a pleasant surprise.</p>

The installation of the vent in our side wall looks great. Your explanation of how the unit operates was very informative and has come in handy.
 
                                Having a split level home where the lower lever was always cooler has been corrected by the installation of this stove. the thermostat keeps the lower level very comfortable. Even during a power failure the stove kept us comfortable.
                       
                                Thank your staff for being prompt, courteous and even did a great job cleaning up afterwards.

                            <p>Chimneys should be evaluated twice a year: before and after burning season. These
                                evaluations will ensure that your chimney is in working order – that there are no
                                obstructions, cracks, animals, footballs, etc. blocking or compromising the integrity of
                                the chimney flue liner. An evaluation before the burning season will ensure that any
                                nests or damage done by outside forces is removed and corrected, in order to prevent a
                                chimney fire during the cold months. An evaluation after burning season will detect
                                whether your chimney has been burning well or if you have been the victim of a chimney
                                fire, without even knowing it. Any time you have your chimney evaluated, your
                                professional sweep should go over any existing or potential problems with you. If you
                                have questions, call us at 410-242-2252.</p>

                                <li>Ingredients – tinder, kindling & fuel
                                    Tinder can be shredded newspaper, small twigs, pine needles or pine cones.
                                    Kindling is the most important ingredient – large twigs, small branches & small
                                    splits of wood anywhere from 1/4″ to 1″ in thickness.
                                    Fuel should only be well-seasoned hardwood. If you have to burn softwoods, be
                                    certain they are well seasoned. Look for split, dry wood that has been stacked for
                                    up to a year. Loose bark and cracks in the ends are signs of seasoned wood.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Starting the fire
                                    You will need a minimum of 3 logs over the kindling. Arrange two small to medium
                                    sized pieces of firewood on the grate, and place some shredded newspaper for tinder
                                    between the logs.
                                    Now cover the tinder or shredded newspaper with several pieces of kindling. Be
                                    generous with kindling – it’s the most important element in starting your fire.
                                    Place three more pieces of firewood on top of the kindling at right to each other.
                                    Leave some space between the logs for air circulation.

                                    Warm up the flue after opening damper all the way
                                    For fireplaces, warm up the flue by holding a piece of burning rolled-up newspaper
                                    in the (opened) damper region for 10-15 seconds. This helps the flue establish a
                                    good draft. Then light the tinder. Within a few minutes, you should have a nice,
                                    hot, roaring fire!
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <strong>
                                <p>What should I do when my fire starts to smoke into the room? </p>
                            </strong>
                            <p>First, put on a fireproof glove and check to see if your damper is open. If it is and the
                                smoking continues, open a nearby window a crack for a minute or two, until the fire is
                                going well, then close it again.
                                If it just smokes when you light the fire, it may be because the flue is cold. Did you
                                warm the flue with a burning rolled-up newspaper held in the damper region? If not, that
                                usually works.
                                If the chimney continues to smoke, call a chimney professional. Your chimney may be
                                clogged by animal nests or an accumulation of soot and creosote, or have additional
                                problems. You should have an ash can with lid and wooden handle and a complete set of
                                fireplace tools so you can safely remove the burning logs in case you need to.
                                What is the best kind of wood to use? Use only well-seasoned hardwood (oak, hickory). If
                                you have to burn softwoods (fir, cedar), be certain they are well seasoned. Look for
                                split, dry wood that has been stacked for up to a year. Loose bark and cracks in the
                                ends are signs of seasoned wood. One easy way to tell is: if it drops its leaves, it’s
                                better to burn than if it stays green all year, i.e. evergreens.

                            <p>Freestanding stoves can be connected to chimneys built especially for them. The chimneys
                                may be of masonry construction or be a factory-built metal system that’s been designed,
                                tested and listed for use with wood burning appliances. Freestanding stoves can also
                                connect to an existing fireplace chimney, if the height and position of the stove’s flue
                                collar permits it. When this type of installation is done, the stoves may be called
                                hearth stoves.</p>
                            <p>
                                Fireplace inserts are a special type of wood stove and are specifically designed to fit
                                into the firebox (where logs normally go) of an existing fireplace and to use the
                                fireplace flue to vent smoke and other by-products of combustion. Since the insert must
                                be smaller than the fireplace opening, there is usually a surround panel attached to the
                                stove which extends out around the fireplace opening to seal the firebox from room air.

                                <p>How often should I have my furnace chimney checked?</p>
                            </strong>
                            <p>These chimneys should be checked annually and cleaned as necessary.
                                How do I know if my furnace chimney needs to be cleaned?
                                If you have an oil furnace, you may see smoke around the connection pipes and a build up
                                of soot on top of the furnace and hot water heater. Extreme abnormal amount of heat in
                                the area of the furnace and connecting pipes may be another sign that the oil furnace
                                chimney needs to be cleaned.

                                If you have a gas furnace, which burns clear and odorless, a CO (carbon monoxide)
                                detector is a must. One of the only ways to keep your family safe is to install one in
                                your home. If your CO detector goes off, ventilate the area and exit the house. Call
                                your local gas and electric company for procedures. Carbon monoxide is deadly and should
                                be treated as an emergency situation.</p>
                            <strong>
                                <p>How important is a CO detector?</p>
                            </strong>
                            <p>A carbon monoxide detector is extremely important to the safety of your family. Because
                                gas burns clear and odorless, it is nearly impossible to know if you are being poisoned
                                by it. Should your CO detector activate, day or night, treat the situation as an
                                emergency. At night, check to see if everyone in the house is awake and alert. Make sure
                                the house is evacuated of humans and pets. Call your local gas and electric company’s
                                emergency number from the neighbor’s house and the operator will instruct you what
                                procedures to follow.</p>

                            </strong>
                            <p>Two important reasons:

                                There were over 15,500 dryer vent fires last year. Even though people clean out their
                                lint filter, they don’t realize that the dryer vent duct is where lint really builds up
                                and gets clogged. The lint is highly flammable, which leads to dryer fires.
                                Lint buildup make the dryer use more energy to dry clothes. If the dryer is not drying
                                efficiently, it is taking more money to dry and re-dry your clothes.</p>
                            <strong>
                                <p>How do I know that my dryer vent needs to be cleaned?</p>
                            </strong>
                            <p>If your dryer doesn’t seem to be drying clothes well, chances are the dryer vent is
                                clogged up.</p>
                            <strong>
                                <p>Can I clean my own dryer vent?</p>
                            </strong>
                            <p>Yes and no. If you have a short “run”, cleaning your own vent may be an option. However,
                                today’s longer runs, some of which extend across the basement or laundry room ceiling
                                and make several turns along the way, are more complicated and require a professional.
                                The best solution is to find a professional duct cleaner to evaluate your dryer vent and
                                clean it with their specialized tools.</p>
